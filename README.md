## How to use 
1. Run kf_processing.py to obtain KF data processing results. Tune the parameters inside it for various KF prameter setting.
2. Run analyze_xxx.py for result analysis
3. If you need to generate new data other than the one used in the article, run data_generation.py. The dataset used in the article is also generated by this code but may be different everytime, because there are stochastic errors contained in the generated data.

Refer to the paper for the step-by-step KF design and optimization.
